First off, we'll host the [Javascript for Absolute Beginners Workshop weekend](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool/events/84329602/) again: on the 13th and 14th of October, we invite you to join us at co.up for some awesome code learning. But this time **we'll be hosting day one as a joint event** with [Stockholm](!!!!). If you happen to be around and would like to help us coach, [join the conversation here](http://groups.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/group/discuss.stockholm). We are very excited to be expanding our movement to this lovely city, once again starting off with our awesome JS workshop. That won't be the only OTS event in Stockholm - we are currently planning to host at least another workshop and the first Beginners Meetup there later this month. Join our very own [OTS-Stockholm meetup](http) group to stay informed, and if you'd like to help us implement OTS there permanently, let us know.

There's more: in just a few days, we'll host the [Beginners Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool/events/84138972/) in Berlin again. Another thing I'm very excited about is the weekly [Micro Hack Day](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool/events/84336562/) sessions we'll be kicking off this Saturday, Oct 6th. Every Saturday, a few of us get together in a bar/caf√©/restaurant to hack on our projects and we'd like to invite you to join. The idea is to to be around people hacking on code, share ideas and thoughts, and discuss tech problems or things you're stuck on. Unlike other hacking sessions, this one is **explicitly open to beginners who are working on their first projects** or working on an online course they can do mostly on their own but in which they might be stuck somwhere. We are here to help!

On top of that, we are also looking into creating workshops on [git](https://groups.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/coaches.git) and [Math-3D](http://blog.opentechschool.org/2012/09/call-for-coaches-math-3d.html) (coach [sign up here](http://groups.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/group/coaches.math-3d)). So if you are interested in either one (or both), join the conversation(s) and let's make it happen.
