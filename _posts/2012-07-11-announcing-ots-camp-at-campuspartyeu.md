I'm **very** glad to announce that [OpenTechSchool will be offering workshops during CampusParty](http://www.campus-party.eu/2012/developers.html#OpenTechSchool). Yes, we will participate in this week-long tech event, taking place on Tempelhofer Feld in Berlin from August 21 to the 26th. With 10,000 participants, developers, and tech enthusiasts from all over Europe, and over 600 hours of content, workshops, hackathons, presentations, and who knows what else, it will be one of the biggest tech events this city has ever seen. Awesome, right?

Well, it's even more awesome than you thought: OpenTechSchool will be there as well. But if you think we'll just be presenting the OTS initiative on stage, you don't know us very well. Even though there will be a few lightning talks on the developer stage by our coaches on day one, the real stuff is going to happen elsewhere: we've been promised to have our own lounge area, where we'll set up OTS camp -  the meeting point for the various workshops on many different topics we will host there. For the actual coaching, we'll head off to the desks around us.

We'll be included in the official floor plan of the event and our workshops might even be published in the official schedule, if we come up with concrete plans on time. One thing that will definitely be included is our call for coaches during the event: if anyone feels like coaching learners on any topic at all, they should just come by and we'll help them get started. Open for us means; spreading the joy of teaching to everyone!

At the moment, we are thinking of doing Javascript, Python, and Ruby workshops, some for beginners and some more advanced, probably covering the same material multiple times throughout the event. But we are still in the planning stages, so if you have a great idea or want to help us coach, [let us know via this form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGsxZlkzSjdTM2ROTkJaX0g2azhiSVE6MQ)! Coaches will be receiving a free ticket to the event, which is a definite bonus to the gratification you will receive by teaching what you love and providing an awesome "aha!" to the person at your side.

Get your ticket now or wait for our community raffle (to be announced soon) and join us for great workshops during an amazing festival!
