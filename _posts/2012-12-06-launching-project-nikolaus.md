A lot has happened since we created our first version of the website back in July. Not only did we move to [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-berlin/) to manage most of our events, grow in team members and add plenty of [learning materials](http://www.openTechSchool.org/material.html), we also set up the OpenTechSchool in another City - [Stockholm](http://www.opentechschool.org/stockholm/. But the website didn't reflect any of those changes, so we decided to redo everything from the ground up. And I am very proud to announce that 'Project Nikolaus' officially took off and you can [see the results online](http://www.openTechSchool.org/) as of now. But 'Project Nikolaus' isn't just a redesign of a website, it is much more than that and I'd like to take the time to explain a few aspects of it to you in this blog post.

## New: City-Pages
More than once we found ourself troubled with the question 'how will future learners figure out how they can participate in OpenTechSchool events?'. And while we are using [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com) to manage those events, there is very little room in each Meetup Group to present oneself. So we decided to have dedicated Pages for each city/location we are organising workshops and events in. As of now those are [Berlin](http://www2.opentechschool.org/berlin/) and [Stockholm](http://www2.opentechschool.org/stockholm/). 

Those pages are built around each meetup group and now contain only the relevant local aspects for each city: Aside from the huge join-this-group-button in the header, you'll also find the blog-posts and upcoming events of that group and the Team that is running the local organisation. By putting all this content right there, we freed ourselves from the burden of having to aggregate it all and still keep it pertinent to the viewer. With the new city-pages in place you can now find all information relevant for your local OpenTechSchool-Group at one glance.

![Berlin City Page](/assets/content/2012-12-06-project-nikolaus/berlin.png)

And when you scroll down even further you'll find another important change: City Twitter Accounts. Yes, that is right, we decided to create dedicated twitter accounts for each city to keep the relevance level for followers high. Getting over-excited by the announcement of an awesome workshop and clicking the link just to figure out it is no where near a reachable location for you is a rather disappointing experience. With our new localised Twitter-Accounts you can follow exactly those teams organising workshops in your area and keep the general OTS-Account free of those.

## Going Global: more content

With those organisational things being at a dedicated place of relevance we decided to shift the focus of the main page away from the Berlin group towards the bigger picture. For a while we've been thinking and working on various [Handbooks and How-Tos](http://www2.opentechschool.org/handbooks/), the so called "blueprints", as part of our on-going goal to document everything we do to give it to others. So with this update we also publish a bunch of new documents, from guides on how to contribute to [learners material](http://www2.opentechschool.org/handbooks/contribute.html) or [the blog](http://www2.opentechschool.org/handbooks/blog-posts.html), over how we usually [create new workshops](http://www2.opentechschool.org/handbooks/new-workshop.html) up to the [city blueprint](http://www2.opentechschool.org/handbooks/city-blueprint.html) with learnings from setting up OTS in Berlin and Stockholm, which should enable others to start their own local OpenTechSchool.

![The new footer: full of stuff.](/assets/content/2012-12-06-project-nikolaus/footer.png)

On top, we also started the [Material Directory](http://www2.opentechschool.org/material.html), a central list of all learners material created by our awesome OpenTechSchool coaches over the last month and more to come, a [completely new press-section](http://www2.opentechschool.org/press.html) with a short description in over six languages already(and more to come) and a press coverage listing area and added [a contacts page](http://www2.opentechschool.org/contact.html) with a more profound explanation about the various teams we have and who you should talk to get stuff done. And we also used this update to release material we have been using internally for a while already, like the [Coaches Guide](http://opentechschool.github.com/slides/presentations/coaching/), the [Style guide](http://www2.opentechschool.org/handbooks/styles.html) or the [guidelines on promoting 3rd party content and workshops](http://www2.opentechschool.org/handbooks/promotion.html). We also took this chance to re-iterate our [core-values and give more background on our history](http://www2.opentechschool.org/about.html)...

## More presentable

_And now to something totally else_: Ain't it pretty? Seriously, it looks soooo much better!

Don't get me wrong, the old one-pager-website was fine - for where we where when we did it. But this movement has grown, we are not only [presenting](http://geekgirlmeetupberlin.wordpress.com/2012/09/23/thank-you/) [ourself](https://www.campus-party.eu/2012/developers.html#OpenTechSchool "OpenTechSchool presented at CampusParty") [at conferences](http://open-strategies.de/sessions/opentechschool "OpenTechSchool presented at Summit of Newthinking") but also [how we do things](http://open-strategies.de/sessions/opencurriculum-github-for-the-win "OpenCurriculum: Github for the Win"), are invited by learning facilities to help them coach coding and currently work together with the county library of Berlin to make sure they have [a good stash of coding- and tech-books](https://github.com/OpenTechSchool/bookshelf). It was about time that our website reflects our progress.

![The beautiful Testimonials](/assets/content/2012-12-06-project-nikolaus/testimonials.png)

That is why we also took good care in providing not only a sufficient and really good looking [Team-List](http://www2.opentechschool.org/team.html) of people working on the high-level concept of things, but also provide exactly those [blueprints](http://www2.opentechschool.org/handbooks/), a [press](http://www2.opentechschool.org/press.html) and [contacts](http://www2.opentechschool.org/contact.html)-section - and [Testimonials](http://www2.opentechschool.org/testimonials.html). Oh, those [Testimonials](http://www2.opentechschool.org/testimonials.html), lying in our <abbr title="we actually did them for the first iteration but never found the time to integrate them">drawer for way to long</abbr>, interviews with a coach, a learner and a learner-to-be presented in a really great way - with a slideshow and quotes and everything!


## Really licensed

Lastly, one very important decision that has been taken meanwhile, was the licensing of our content. [It was decided that](https://groups.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/d/msg/discuss.global/GhpjAcmk9Fk/hhc7cYF-2bkJ) we will license our content under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US). And not only our values are stating that but the footer of every page shows exactly that openess we are so proud of.

## More than an "just an update"

As you can see, this is not only an update or a simple relaunch of the website. The launch of "Project Nikolaus" is a milestone in the development of the OpenTechSchool Movement reflecting those changes we've gone through over this year. It really is the next iteration in what we are doing here. And that is why it isn't enough to just thank everyone, who contributed, coded, wrote, tested, translated, designed and thought on this next iteration.

'Project Nikolaus' actually acts the other way round. It is a big THANKS YOU every contributor, writer and coach, to everyone who supported us over this year: without you and your tremendous amount of passion and dedicaton, this movement wouldn't be where it is today. And Therefore this update impossible. So,

**Thank you, enjoy your [new website](http://www2.opentechschool.org)!**
