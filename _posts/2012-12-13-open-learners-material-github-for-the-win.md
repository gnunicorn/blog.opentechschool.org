As some of you already know, [Amélie](http://open-strategies.de/speaker/37) and [I](http://open-strategies.de/speaker/27) were on stage at the [Summit of Newthinking](http://newthinking.de/summit-of-newthinking/) about a month ago. Amélie gave a great talk about what we do at [OpenTechSchool on day one](http://vimeo.com/54966142) and I had a slot to talk about how we use Git, GitHub and GitHub Pages to write and organise our learning material. This was something I had wanted to document for a while, but before actually committing to it for that talk, I had never found the courage to actually do so. However, now that the full video is available online, I'd like to share it with you. 

Here is the [presentation](http://opentechschool.github.com/slides/presentations/opencurriuculum-github-for-the-win/) (to use the slides, click on the first one and then use your arrow keys) and the [video recording](http://vimeo.com/55273023):

I hope you learn something. :)
